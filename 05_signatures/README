createSignature.m : takes a ZOOM mat file containing "indexFromSparce" list.  
                    Exports an ASCII file with file name and indexFromSparce.

createTranslate.m : writes a two-column ASCII file, 
                    first column is file name, second is abbreviation as uint64

oneSigM2sigCell.m : converts 2 column matrix (runNumber indexFromSparse) 
                    into 2 column cell ( fileName indexFromSparse ) 
                    NOTE: may not be needed it if everything moved to a single H5 file. 
                          Keep it for now.

readTranslate.m  : reads ASCII translate file and loads it in a CELL structure

### SOME VARIABLES:

sigM : 2 column matrix characteristic for each snapshot
sigCell : 2 column cell, includes file name



### LEGACY ###

oneSignature2matrix.m : takes 2-item CELL and returns 2-item uint64 matrix
                        NOT NEEDED WITH SIGM FORMAT

oneMatrix2signature.m : takes 2-item matrix and returns 2-item cell
                        it requires the "translate file"
                        CONVERTED TO oneMatrix2signature.m
			
signature2matrix.m : as oneSignature2matrix.m but applies to a many-row cell
                     TAKES TOO MUCH TIME (> 12 hours)
                     NOT NEEDED WITH SIGM FORMAT

matrix2signature.m : as oneMatrix2signature.m but applies to a many-row matrix
                     NOT TESTED
                     NOT NEEDED WITH SIGM FORMAT


"readSignature.m" must become "readTranslate.m", since sigCell (cell structures) are deprecated now.


mindex2snapshot : convert it to signature2snapshot.  NO MORE INDEXES
oneSigM2sigCell.m : may not be needed in move to a single H5 file. Keep it for now.


writeSignature.m : takes CELL signature and exports it as ASCII
                   NOT NEEDED WITH SIGM FORMAT

readSignature.m  : reads ASCII signature file and loads it in a CELL structure
                   NOT NEEDED WITH SIGM FORMAT
